This folder contains the complete implementation of the project "RBM vs PCA: Dimensionality Reduction Techniques". It includes all core scripts 
for preprocessing, model training, dimensionality reduction using PCA and RBM, visualization of reduced features, and evaluation metrics. The code is modular, 
well-documented, and structured to allow easy experimentation 
and comparison between the two methods.
