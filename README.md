# RBM vs PCA: A Comparative Study of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

## Project Overview
This project aims to compare two prominent dimensionality reduction techniques — Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) — and evaluate their performance on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Dimensionality reduction is crucial when dealing with high-dimensional data, as it helps reduce computational costs, improve model performance, and enables data visualization in 2D/3D.

The main objectives include:

Reducing MNIST's 784-dimensional image data into lower dimensions (e.g., 2D, 3D).

Reconstructing the original data from the reduced representations.

Evaluating reconstruction error and classification performance.

Analyzing the effectiveness of linear vs. non-linear methods.
